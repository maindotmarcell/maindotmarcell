## Hi there 👋

I'm Marcell and I enjoy working with everything that has to do with distributed systems including cloud technologies, blockchain, fintech, observability and security 🧑🏻‍💻

Currently I'm mainly working with **Typescript** and **Go** along with cloud native goodies such as **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Jenkins** and **AWS**. 
Although now I'm leaning more towards the backend and even infrastucture side of the spectrum, during my previous roles I also became proficient in **React** and **Java**, during which time I primarily focused on the frontend. 

Have a look at some of my pinned side-projects / open-source contributions and hit me if you want to get in contact :)
